= Affective Computing, Emotional Development and Autism

== Abstract

=== Introductions and Motivations

==== Affective computing and child development
affective computing and child development:
1. Non-verbal communication less impacted by social display rules
2. Interventions could help children develop optimally

==== affective computing and development of ASD
ASD - Autism Spectrum Disorders
1. objective:  dection and modeling of emotion / interventions
2. object: children with ASD and their high-risk sibling
3. reason: symptons merges before age3 / siblings offer a prospective view
TODO:change it

=== Automated Measurement of Emotional Behaviour

==== Automated Facial Measurement
1. manual measurement of facial expression is laborious and resourcce-intensive
2. use facial action coding system
3. common pipeline: AASMs + SVM

==== Emotion Measurement via Continuous Ratings


==== Applying Automated and other measurement to early emotion expression
==== modeling emotional communication
==== machine learning approaches to modeling dyadic interaction
==== modeling vocal interactions with cross-recurrence quantification analysis
==== electrodermal activity, measurement and Applications to ASD
=== Translational Applications of Affective Computing to Children with ASD
==== embodies conversational agents
==== Robots and Autism
1. purpose: understand affective, communicative and social difference with ASD,
develop novel interventions and enhance existing treatments for children with
ASD
2. advantages: ASD show a preference for robot likke characteristics / capable
of utilising physical motion compared to screen technologies
=== Conclusion and discussion of alternative approaches
==== overview
==== facial expression
==== vocalisations and electrodermal activations
==== multi-modal fusion
==== modeling advances
==== what modeling approach is most appropriate
==== modeling to detect interaction
==== modeling to simulate development
==== software agents
==== robots
==== ethics and outcomes in a changing world
